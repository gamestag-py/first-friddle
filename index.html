                With over 30 restaurants in 23 years under his belt, the prolific restaurateur Priyank Sukhija
                has become somewhat of a legend in the industry, starting his journey at a mere age of 19.
                Priyank was the first in his family to venture into business, hailing from a family of lawyers,
                going on to create an empire in F&B. Following his heart and tongue through his F&B career,
                Priyank has successfully created some of the most talked-about brands in the industry â€“ Diablo,
                Lord of the Drinks, Plum by Bent Chair, Lazeez Affaire, Tamasha, The Flying Saucer Cafe, and many more.
